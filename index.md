### Image Side Quest

When working in CV we are often exposed to large datasets of images. It is sometimes fun to take a step back think about the acquisition process of developing these datasets. Photography is another one of my many hobbies, so for fun as a side quest from your development journey - see if you can guess where in Australia this image was captured!
